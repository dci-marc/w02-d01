## About Me

Hello! I'm Marc, a passionate software developer with over 5 years of experience in building web applications and mobile apps. My interest in technology began in my childhood and has stayed with me ever since.

I have extensive knowledge in various programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Java. Currently, I primarily work with modern frameworks like React and Django to create user-friendly and efficient applications.

In addition to programming, I love sharing my knowledge and helping other developers enhance their skills. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and regularly attend meetups to connect with like-minded individuals.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, exploring nature, or experimenting with new technologies.

Let’s connect! I look forward to hearing from you.
